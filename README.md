# german

Commandline tool for german learning/testing/quizs.

It's very much a work in progress and it grows as I want to learn more things.

It started out as a way to explore patterns in verb conjugations and it implements most of the rules from http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/gremple/german.verb.conjugation.html.

It has a quiz feature now.
