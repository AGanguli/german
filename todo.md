## more verbs

* need to handle trennbare verbs
* and some more other prefix ones I suspect I don't handle right now

## ideas

* rank the unregularness for filtering/sorting
* filter by type/hilfsverb/tag
* build index of all conjugations for searching
* record the modifications to each verb to use for highlighting
* output prettily like the old one
* prepare for web version
* rank commonness of base verbs (top100? top50? etc)
* rank occurances of all conjugations (from top10000 as before)
* special mode to highlight only irregularities
